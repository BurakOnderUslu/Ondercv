  <p>After graduation suddenly I went Canadian Language schools at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cllc.ca/">CLLC</a>&<a target="_blank" href="https://www.halifaxlanguageinstitute.com/">HLCC</a> Halifax to enhance my English abilities . The first expreince being abroad had
    passed on a beautiful port city between three monts in 2019. Beginning of 2020, I decided to get my education at Canadian colleges and to pass proficiency exams I went Malta, Sliema for one month at <a href="https://elamalta.com">ELA</a>. While
    having indricate decision to settle on and build web designing career I came across with <a target="_blank" href="https://kodloca.com/"></a>KodLoca, I've been taking lessons to learn HTML,CSS,Java in details on online platforms besides it (udemy etc.). Taking education with contemporary methods instead of ordinary education is always adds difference. I don't
    believe that old classical teaching Institues and Universities can develop a person's point of view of world, consediration statements in life and other important social facts to be right and give true judgment as consequences. By looking for the most unusual ways of self-improvement, people will reach different facts and thoughts, and their lives will be shaped accordingly.</p>
